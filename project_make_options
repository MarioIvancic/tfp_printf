# printf options
# tfp_printf have smaller memory footprint and msp_printf is closer to standard printf.
# in general case, on embedded systems we prefer small code size so we will us tfp_printf
# as default printf implementation.
# you can control it by PRINTF_USE_MSP and/or PRINTF_USE_TFP project options.
# In any case you can #include <msp_printf.h> or #include <tfp_printf.h> and use whichever you need.
